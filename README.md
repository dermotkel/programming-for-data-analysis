## Assignment 2018 - Programming for Data Analysis 

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository contains the assignment for the Programming for Data Analysis module. It is divided into five sections:

- **numpy.random** : The numpy.random library is introduced and the limitations of a Pseudorandom Number Generator are discussed.
- **simple random data** : The basic random functions of the library are introduced and tested. 
- **permutations** : Functions used to randomly sample an existing array are examined.
- **Distributions** : Seven important statistical distributions are explained using numpy.random.
- **Random Generator** : The concept of seeds in numpy.random are introduced. 

I would suggest that you run the notebook from top to bottom in order. If you encounter any problems: 

1. Run the cell immediately above - there may be a return needed from here to run your current cell.
2. If that fails, go back to the top of the notebook and run the cell which imports numpy and the other required packages. 
3. Finally, you may have to close the notebook, kill jupyter notebook on the command line and restart it.
